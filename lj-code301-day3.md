# Week 3

This Week brought some new challenges with learning SQL.  Most of the challenge came with just setting everything up and getting the database and everything working.  You have to remember to do npm init to start it then you have to install all the required stuff such as express, etc.  All in all its fun getting in to more the back end side of things.

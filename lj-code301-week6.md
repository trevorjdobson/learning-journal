# Week 6

This week we went over a lot and it got intense.  We got introduced to heroku and deploying on heroku.  We started building an app from scratch which is a good excersize to see everything come together.  One challege that keeps popping up is the differences across different machines and different operating systems.  This really made this week a challenge.
